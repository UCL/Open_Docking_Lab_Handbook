# Open Docking Lab Handbook
This repository is the place to store and edit the lab handbook for UCL teaching courses that involve the use of open source tools in molecular docking.

Files currently available are shown above, on this "code" tab. The most recent version of the **lab manual** is there, for download and the manual is **also available in full on the wiki** as a living document that can be updated by anyone, year on year. If you'd like to suggest edits it's easy to do that by opening an *Issue* (tab above).

We'd love to hear of new docking tools or scoring functions that we could include.
