# Open Docking Lab Handbook
This repository is the place to store and edit the lab handbook for UCL courses that involve the use of open source tools in molecular docking.

Files currently available are shown above, on this "code" tab.

The handbook is in the process of being made into a living document, on the wiki (link above), that can be updated by anyone.
