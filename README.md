# Open Docking Lab Handbook
This repository is the place to store and edit the lab handbook for UCL teaching courses that involve the use of open source tools in molecular docking.

Files currently available are shown above, on this "code" tab. The most recent version of the lab manual is there, for download.

The manual is also in the process of being made into a living document, on the wiki (in markdown, link above), that can be updated by anyone.

We would very much encourage contributions using new docking tools or scoring functions.
